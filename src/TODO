* Initialize to zero those objects which have a finally block.

* Nullable types? Look at C#. Easy to implement, just need strictly defined
  semantics.

* Strings are immutable, and they are not references like containers. But any
  char vector is a string and thus it's not a reference. What to do? So this is
  a big TODO: implement a string class which is not copy-on-write.

* Can vectors be converted or wrapped in fifos? Implicitly or explicitly?

* Multiple return values: allow to assign them to a vector?

* Optimize function calls: if "self" is not used, allocate the object on
  the stack.

* HTML embedded mode

* Compiler directives: #!DEBUG ON|OFF  #!RANGE_CHECK ON|OFF  #!ASSERT ON|OFF
  #!ECHO ON|OFF  #!EMBED ON|OFF

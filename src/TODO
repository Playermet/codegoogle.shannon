* Support both `return` statement and built-in `result` variable?

* Nullable types? Look at C#. Easy to implement, just need strictly defined
  semantics.

* Can vectors be converted or wrapped in fifos? Implicitly or explicitly?

* Multiple return values: allow to assign them to a vector?

* Optimize function calls: if "self" is not used, allocate the object on
  the stack.

* HTML embedded mode

* Compiler directives: #!DEBUG ON|OFF  #!RANGE_CHECK ON|OFF  #!ASSERT ON|OFF
  #!ECHO ON|OFF  #!EMBED ON|OFF

We must be careful with terms like readable, user-friendly, and so
forth. They are vague at best, and often refer to taste and established
habits. But what is conventional need not also be convenient. In the
context of programming languages, perhaps "readable" should be replaced
by "amenable to formal reasoning." For example, mathematical formulas
are hardly what we might praise as easily readable, but they allow the
formal derivation of properties that could not be obtained from a vague,
fuzzy, informal, user-friendly circumscription.

* State type and state body should belong to one class.

* Support both `return` statement and built-in `result` variable?

* Nullable types? Look at C#. Easy to implement, just need strictly defined
  semantics.

* Can vectors be converted or wrapped in fifos? Implicitly or explicitly?

* Multiple return values: pass a pointer to a preallocated array of vars

* Optimize function calls: if "self" is not used, get the object from a
  stack-like pool.

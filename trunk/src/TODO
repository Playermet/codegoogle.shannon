* functions

* combined assignment operators

* arrays: static, associative and sets (stoDblPtr storage model?)

* vector item selection, only R-value to start with

* lo(), hi(), len()

* is, as (sometimes can be evaluated at compile time)

* a lot of TODO's in the sources

* the yield operator?

* procedures and pipes: pipe is a linked list of procedures, each coupled with
  one connector?

* string table and type table; binary code should contain only indexes

* decide what to do with function call vs. typecast (funcs are types!)

* make push's and pop's macros that operate through the stkbase received by 
  the run() function

* how states can access module-static data? possibly through indirection. so
  module-level functions have thisseg=module, nested functions have 
  thisseg=outer-frame, etc. states and their member functions have 
  thisseg=this
